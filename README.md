# Weather Finde in ReactJS
This project is the continuation of the tutorials I am writing for my upcoming blog teaching ReactJS. Meanwhile the blog is not finished yet (too much to write!), you can download this project and since it is full of comments, you will be ready for my tutorials once they are done!

## Is there a demo?
Yeah, you can test this [here](#)!

## What features this project has?
- ReactJS
- Using async methods
- Using git
- Using API requests
- Parsing API requests
- CSS Animations
- React Components

## How to install it?
Just run this code:
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/NauCode/ReactJS-Project-Structure.git
```

After that, enter in the folder using:
``` bash
cd .\Weather-Finder-ReactJS\
```

And install the dependencies:
``` bash
npm install
```

Run it:
``` bash
npm start
```

And done! You can code your app now using this template!
